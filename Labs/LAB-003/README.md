# Lab-03 (Decision Trees)


## Original Problem Statement

In this Lab I have to implement the Decision Trees . In Decision trees we have to find the best split (means the best condition through which I can divide my problem or node  into futhur child nodes and then recursively doing it for every node until I found the leaf node ) and the best split can be found by using the entropy and calculates the information gain (that's the basic overview of the Decision Trees)
