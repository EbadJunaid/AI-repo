# Lab-04 (K-Nearest Neighbors)


## Original Problem Statement

In this Lab I have to implement the K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier.

The k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is an instance-based learning method used for both classification and regression. For classification, the procedure is as follows:
- Given a test sample, compute the distance (e.g., Euclidean) to all training samples.
- Select the k closest training samples.
- Assign the most common class among these neighbors to the test sample.


Above is the basic overview of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm
